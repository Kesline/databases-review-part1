### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL is an open-source, object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) known for its robustness, scalability, and support for SQL compliance. It is designed to handle various workloads, from small single-machine applications to large internet-facing applications with many concurrent users. PostgreSQL supports advanced data types and performance optimization features, making it suitable for complex queries and data manipulation tasks.

- What is the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language): A standard programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is used to execute queries, retrieve data, insert, update, and delete records, as well as create and modify database structures.

PostgreSQL: A specific implementation of a relational database management system that uses SQL as its query language. PostgreSQL extends the SQL standard with additional features such as support for JSON data types, advanced indexing techniques, full-text search, and custom extensions.


- In `psql`, how do you connect to a database?
In psql, the command-line interface for PostgreSQL, you connect to a database using the \c or \connect command followed by the database name. You can also specify the username and host if needed. 


- What is the difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE`?
WHERE: Used to filter rows before any groupings are made. It specifies conditions on individual rows of data.

HAVING: Used to filter groups after the GROUP BY clause has been applied. It specifies conditions on groups of rows.


- What is the difference between an `INNER` and `OUTER` join?

INNER JOIN: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. If there is no match, the result set will not include rows from either table.
OUTER JOIN: Returns all rows from one table and the matched rows from the second table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the side of the table that lacks the match. Types of outer joins include LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.


- What is the difference between a `LEFT OUTER` and `RIGHT OUTER` join?
LEFT OUTER JOIN (or LEFT JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If no match is found, NULLs are returned for columns from the right table.

RIGHT OUTER JOIN (or RIGHT JOIN): Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. If no match is found, NULLs are returned for columns from the left table.


- What is an ORM? What do they do?

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): A programming technique that allows developers to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm. ORMs map database tables to classes, rows to objects, and columns to attributes. They abstract away the underlying SQL queries, allowing developers to work with database records as if they were regular objects in their programming language.
Purpose: Simplifies database interactions, improves code readability, and reduces the need for boilerplate SQL code. Examples of ORMs include Hibernate (Java), Entity Framework (.NET), and SQLAlchemy (Python).


- What are some differences between making HTTP requests using AJAX 
  and from the server side using a library like `requests`?
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML):

Runs in the client-side browser.
Allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes.
Improves user experience by making web applications more responsive without requiring a full page reload.
Limited by same-origin policy unless using CORS.
Server-side requests (e.g., using requests in Python):

Runs on the server.
Can interact with any external service or API, not limited by the same-origin policy.
Suitable for backend data processing, fetching external resources, or making API calls as part of server-side logic.
Typically used to gather data that will be rendered to the client or stored in a database.


- What is CSRF? What is the purpose of the CSRF token?
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): A type of attack where a malicious actor tricks a user into performing actions on a different website where the user is authenticated. The attacker exploits the user's session to perform unauthorized actions.

CSRF Token: A unique, secret, and unpredictable value generated by the server and included in every form submission or HTTP request that modifies data. The server validates this token to ensure the request is legitimate and originated from the authenticated user, thus preventing CSRF attacks.


- What is the purpose of `form.hidden_tag()`?
In web frameworks like Flask-WTF (a Flask extension for handling forms), form.hidden_tag() is used to render hidden fields in a form. The primary purpose of this is to include CSRF tokens and other hidden data required for form processing and validation. This ensures that the form submission includes necessary hidden data that the server needs to process the form securely and accurately.
